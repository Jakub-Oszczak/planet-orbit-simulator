# planet-orbit-simulator
Warning: Majority of this code was taken from an online course, it's not mine and was only intended for learning purposes

This program simulates orbits of planets and it works on real values.
I've displayed a distance to sun of each planet to show that the orbit is actually elliptic.
Current program simulates only Mercury, Venus, Eart and Mars, but the code is written in such way that adding or removing planets can be easily done.

What I have mainly learned while making this project is how to make things move in pygame and how to implement simple physics in games.
